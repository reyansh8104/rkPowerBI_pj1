# 📊 Advanced Bank Loan Data Analysis Dashboard

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to transform traditional bank loan reporting methods into a **dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard** that empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. The dashboard is built using real-world loan data and highlights key insights about loan performance, borrower behavior, and overall financial metrics.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a comprehensive suite of interconnected dashboards that:
- Provide a holistic view of lending operations.
- Track and visualize KPIs such as loan application trends, funded amounts, repayment patterns, and borrower demographics.
- Distinguish between good and bad loans using financial metrics like Interest Rate and Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio.

## 🗂️ Files Included

- `bank_loan_data_insights.pbix`: Power BI dashboard project file.
- `financial_loan.csv`: Raw dataset used for analysis.
- `analytical_BI_report.pdf`: Analytical report describing the dashboards, insights, and data model.

## 📈 Key Dashboards

### 1. Executive Summary
- Total Loan Applications (overall, MTD, MoM trends)
- Total Funded Amount
- Total Amount Received
- Average Interest Rate
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
- Breakdown of Good vs Bad Loans
